# Flowchart: How the `useEffect` Code Works in the Manager Component

## Overview
This document explains the flow of the `useEffect` hook in the `Manager` component that loads passwords from `localStorage` when the component mounts.

## Code Flow

1. **Component Mounts**:
   - The `Manager` component is rendered.
   - The `useEffect` hook is triggered because it has an empty dependency array (`[]`), meaning it runs only once when the component is mounted.

2. **Fetching Data from `localStorage`**:
   - The first operation inside `useEffect` is fetching the stored passwords from `localStorage`:
     ```javascript
     const storedPasswords = localStorage.getItem('passwords');
     ```

3. **Check if Data Exists**:
   - The code checks if `storedPasswords` is not `null`:
     ```javascript
     if (storedPasswords) {
     ```
   - If `storedPasswords` is `null`, it means no passwords have been saved previously, and the component does nothing in this case.

4. **Parsing JSON Data**:
   - If the passwords are found in `localStorage`, the data (which is a JSON string) is parsed into a JavaScript object:
     ```javascript
     const parsedData = JSON.parse(storedPasswords);
     ```

5. **Updating State**:
   - After parsing the data, the `setInf` function is called to update the `inf` state with the parsed passwords:
     ```javascript
     setInf(parsedData);
     ```

6. **Re-renders Component**:
   - After the state is updated with the passwords, React triggers a re-render of the component.
   - Now, the `inf` state contains the passwords retrieved from `localStorage`, which can be used to display them in the UI.
